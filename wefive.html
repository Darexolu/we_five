    <h1>WE FIVE</h1>
    <p>We five was founded in 2018 with a mission to change the way cybersecurity is consumed by providing a top-down, business-oriented approach to cyber defense.Advances in artificial intelligence and new ways of thinking about cybersecurity are leading to new approaches that will better protect organizations from costly attacks and more effectively manage risk. To help IT professionals gain understanding of these coming changes,here is a list of terms that are relevant to how cybersecurity will be managed in 2023 and beyond.

    <p>
        <h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI) Reasoning Engine</h3>
        Artificial intelligence (AI) is an umbrella term encompassing different computer-based technologies that replicate human problem solving or decision making. Within the cybersecurity world,machine Learning is the most widely used AI based approach. Machine learning is based on the statistical identification of hidden patterns within a large amount of data,and so it is applied to anomaly detection,log analysis and behavioural based attack detection. 
        Orchestra Group has developed an AI reasoning engine based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This engine is used to run millions of attack path simulations (APS) against the Digital Cyber Twin of the real network. The result is an accurate identification analysis of cyber exposures risks and how to efficiently mitigate the most significant exposures.  </p>
    <p><h3>Attack Path Scenario</h3>
    An Attack Path Scenario (APS) is the set of steps a cyber attacker can follow to gain unauthorized access to an asset.An APS begins with the initial breach of a system which is then leveraged to access other systems. eventually arriving at the target asset. The ability to effectively simulate Attack Path Scenarios provides the foundation for:
    <ul><li>Measuring and understanding the cyber risks and exposures facing an organization</li>
        <li>Identifying the highest priority and most impactful protective measures and needed to reduce risk.
        </li>
        <li>Maintaining a posture of cyber resilience.   
        </li>
    </ul>     
 </p>
    <p><h3>Attack Surface</h3>
    The attack surface is best defined as every possible point where an adversary can gain entry into your network or system. As evidenced by the diverse list of attack vectors, the attack surface is not limited to the network perimeter.Attackers have many means of accessing internal systems without needing a first breach a perimeter,internet facing device </p>
    <p><h3>Attack Vector</h3>
    An attack vector is amethod that cyber-attackers use to compromise a system. Attack vectors take many forms, but the most common attack vectors are:
<ul><li>Phishing</li>
<li>Vulnerability Exploit</li>
</ul>
</p>
    <p><h3>Attacker's Eye View</h3>
        The attacker's eye view is a cybersecurity approach that attempts to understand exactly how an attacker could successfully carry out an attack. The value of an attacker's eye view is this: By identifying how attackers could breach a network, security personnelgain the information they need to take remedial action before attackers exploit the identified exposures. Running comprehensive breach and attack simulations against a live network is not a practical approach due to the likely impact on operations.Thus a Digital Cyber Twin of the actual network.
